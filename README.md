## Simple JavaScript Tests with Deferred

This project demonstrates basic use of jQuery deferred objects to write JavaScript tests. The 2 examples include simulating an Ajax post call, and performing events after the .hide() animation of a DOM element. The project includes both the running HTML/Javascript code in the root of the project, as well as the code to write the JavaScript tests in the `js-tests` directory.

## Libraries

This project uses the jQuery, QUnit, and Sinon libraries.

## Installation and Execution

The code should be ready to run as is. To view the HTML example, open `page.html` with an internet browser such as Chrome. To run the JavaScript tests, open the `js-tests/index.html` in an internet browser.
